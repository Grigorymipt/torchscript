#1. Search Procedures
There are two main types of procedures on the site:
A - Competitions
B - Reductions
Note: The search depends on the selected area of queries. So, when selecting a query from the "Web Contests" area, the search for contests will not be possible until the search query is selected from the "Web Contests" line. Figure 1 presents the result when selecting all published reductions, and Figure 2 presents the result when searching for published contests.

In the list of results should appear all competitions that meet the specified criteria.

Check the selected criteria;
- check the status of the contest, if you are looking for an ongoing contest, then the type of search query for the web-contest “Everything” should have been selected.
Note: there may be no competitions for the selected search criteria, in which case the table of results will be empty, an example is shown in Figure 5.

#2. Use of Filters to Limit the Competition List
Filters can be used to reduce the list of competitions. To install the filter, it is necessary:
(a) In the list of competitions click on the name of the column
(b) In the menu that appears, select “User-defined filter...”
(c) In the “User Filter” window, enter the search value. When specifying the search value, it is recommended to use *. Words in * will be searched anywhere in the row in the table. If only before the word, then the names that end with the word. If after him, they start with him.

For example, "*Terepovets*" will search for all the lines containing in the name Cherepovets regardless of the register. As suitable values in the issuance may be:
- Cherepovets Port;
- Cherepovets;
- Warehouse of the Cherepovets port

Note: For greater efficiency, it is recommended to use columns for filtering:
- Location - Contains information on where the cargo is planned to be delivered / place of service;
- Description of the event – The name of the competition, often buyers indicate in the title what exactly is declared for purchase within the framework of the procedure;
- Event Status – This column allows you to filter out all contests with a given status. Effective if the search is carried out in competitions of all types.
The list of actions necessary to create a user filter is presented in Figure 8.
